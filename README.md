[![Libtask Testing](https://github.com/TuringLang/Libtask.jl/workflows/Libtask%20Testing/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TuringLang/Libtask.jl/actions?branch=main)


Resumable and copyable functions in Julia, with optional dynamic scope.
See the docs for example usage.

Used in the [Turing](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) probabilistic programming language to implement various particle-based inference methods, for example those in [AdvancedPS.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedPS.jl/).
